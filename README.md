Tournament Tracker is a Winforms desktop application that allows users to create and play through elimination-style tournaments (e.g. an indoor soccer tournament). 
It allows users to create team members, form teams and specify prizes. The application proceeds to randomize the rounds and matchups to create a tournament.

The application conists of 5 different forms:

1. Tournament Dashboard Form: Will allow you to see all active tournaments that are currently taking place.
