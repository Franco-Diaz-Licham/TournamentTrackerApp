Tournament Tracker is a Winforms desktop application that allows users to create and play through elimination-style tournaments (e.g. an indoor soccer tournament). 
It allows users to create team members, form teams and specify prizes. The application proceeds to randomize the rounds and matchups to create a tournament.

This was completed as a practice project following along Tim Corey's course on C# Windows Forms application development.
